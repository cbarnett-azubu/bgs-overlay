   * Hi! Thanks for using XSplit JS Framework :)
   *
   * XSplit JS Framework exposes useful methods to work with XSplit without 
   * fiddling too much with the raw core methods exposed to JavaScript, which 
   * makes developing plugins for XSplit a lot easier.
   *
   * To get started, you just have to require our library:
   * var xjs = require('xjs');
   *
   * You can read more about it at our documentation:
   * http://xjsframework.github.io/quickstart.html
   * http://xjsframework.github.io/tutorials.html
   * http://xjsframework.github.io/api.html
   */
  var xjs = require('xjs');

  xjs.ready().then(function() {
    // Write your code here
  });
})();
